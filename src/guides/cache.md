Caching in nyxx is managed automatically with internal wrappers around existing Dart features. Nyxx features a 
[`Cache<T, S>`](https://nyxx.l7ssha.xyz/dartdocs/nyxx/nyxx/Cache-class.html) interface which is the base class for all caches used in the library. 
Like any other aspect of nyxx, cache handling can be altered to fit your needs.

</br>

You can pass an instance of `CacheOptions` when creating your `Nyxx` instance to alter caching behavior across the whole bot:

```dart
/// Options for configuring cache. Allows to specify where and which entities should be cached and preserved in cache
class CacheOptions {
  /// Defines in which locations members will be cached
  CachePolicyLocation memberCachePolicyLocation = CachePolicyLocation();

  /// Defines which members are preserved in cache
  CachePolicy<IMember> memberCachePolicy = MemberCachePolicy.def;

  /// Defines where channel entities are preserved cache. Defaults to [CachePolicyLocation] with additional objectConstructor set to true
  CachePolicyLocation channelCachePolicyLocation = CachePolicyLocation()..objectConstructor = true;

  /// Defines which channel entities are preserved in cache.
  CachePolicy<IChannel> channelCachePolicy = ChannelCachePolicy.def;

  /// Defines in which places user can be cached
  CachePolicyLocation userCachePolicyLocation = CachePolicyLocation();

  /// Defines in which locations members will be cached
  CachePolicyLocation messageCachePolicyLocation = CachePolicyLocation();

  /// Defines which members are preserved in cache
  CachePolicy<IMessage> messageCachePolicy = MessageCachePolicy.def;
}
}
```

</br>

For now there are a few things you can do:
 1. Alter when objects are added to cache (from websocket events or HTTPS requests);
 2. Control which objects are added to cache (by specifying a predicate to choose which objects to cache)

</br>
 
#### CachePolicyLocation

This setting allows to specify when object are added to the cache:
 - `event`: Objects are cached from websocket events;
 - `objectConstructor`: Objects are cached from other object's constructors, for example `Member` objects from message payloads;
 - `http`: Objects are added from HTTP API requests;
 - `other`: All other times an object could be cached.

</br>

As an example, this code would only cache `Member` objects from websocket events and http API requests:
```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  final cacheOptions = CacheOptions()
    ..memberCachePolicyLocation = (
        CachePolicyLocation()
          ..event = true
          ..http = true
    );
  
  final bot = NyxxFactory.createNyxxWebsocket("token", 10, cacheOptions: cacheOptions);
}
```

</br>

#### CachePolicy

Another option to restrict caching is to specify a `CachePolicy` which is a class that wraps a callback executed when trying to cache objects.

`CachePolicy` can be freely composed with provided base methods or extended by the end developer:
```dart
/// Convenience method to concatenate other policy
CachePolicy<T> or(CachePolicy<T> other);

/// Convenience method to require other policy
CachePolicy<T> and(CachePolicy<T> other);

/// Composes a policy by concatenating multiple other policies from list
static CachePolicy<S> any<S extends SnowflakeEntity>(List<CachePolicy<S>> policies);
```

</br>

For example, this code would only cache `Member` objects who have roles:
```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  final cacheOptions = CacheOptions()
    ..memberCachePolicy = CachePolicy<Member>((member) => member.roles.isNotEmpty);
  
  final bot = NyxxFactory.createNyxxWebsocket("token", 10, cacheOptions: cacheOptions);
}
```
