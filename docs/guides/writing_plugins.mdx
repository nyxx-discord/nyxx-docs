Plugins in nyxx are a way to create modular functionality that can be easily added or removed from
clients. There are some offical plugins - including `logging` and `cliIntegration` in the `nyxx`
package, but also `CommandsPlugin` from `nyxx_commands` or `Pagination` from `nyxx_extensions` - but
you can also create your own plugins for your own functionality.

## Using plugins

Plugins can be added to a client by passing them to the `plugins` list in `ClientOptions` when
creating your client. For example, this client registers the `logging` plugin, the `cliIntegration`
plugin, the `PluginA()` plugin and the `PluginB()` plugin:
```dart
final client = await Nyxx.connectGateway(
  'TOKEN',
  GatewayIntents.allUnprivileged,
  options: GatewayClientOptions(plugins: [
    logging,
    cliIntegration,
    PluginA(),
    PluginB(),
  ]),
);
```

Plugins can be easily enabled or disabled by adding or removing them from this list, allowing you to
quickly enable or disable certain features of your bot.

Some plugins in the official nyxx packages provide a ready-to-use instance. This is the case with
the `logging` and `cliIntegration` plugins above. You can always create your own instances of the
`Logging` or `CliIntegation` classes instead.

## Plugin basics

The easiest way to create a plugin is to extend the `NyxxPlugin` class. The type argument allows you
to specify which client types your plugin can be added to.

A simple plugin that logs messages received from clients it is added to would look like this:
```dart
class LogMessages extends NyxxPlugin<NyxxGateway> {
  @override
  void afterConnect(NyxxGateway client) {
    client.onMessageCreate.listen((event) {
      final message = event.message;

      // logger is provided by the plugin interface.
      logger.info('${message.id} sent by ${message.author.id} in ${message.channelId}!');
    });
  }
}
```

Plugins can override the `beforeConnect`, `afterConnect`, `beforeClose` and `afterClose` methods to
run code at different moments in the client's lifecycle. These methods can be async and will pause
the associated method on the client until the returned future completes.

`beforeConnect` and `afterConnect` run during calls to the `Nyxx.connectXXX` methods.
- `beforeConnect` runs before the client establishes any connections to Discord, so it's a good idea
  to put any plugin initialisation here.
- `afterConnect` runs once the client has opened a connection to Discord. This is the first time
  your plugin will be able to access the client, so any setup requiring the client (e.g listening to
  events) should go here.

:::caution
Putting plugin initialisation in `afterConnect` will cause any events received during the plugin's
initialisation to be dropped. The client is only returned to the caller after the call to
`afterConnect` completes.
:::

`beforeClose` and `afterClose` run during calls to `client.close()`.
- `beforeClose` runs before the client has disconnected from Discord. Put any cleanup that requires
  the client here.
- `afterClose` runs once the client has completely disconnected from Discord. Since the client is
  disconnected, it can no longer be used and will not be passed to your plugin.

## Plugin states

By default, plugins can be added to multiple clients at once, and the same plugin instance will
manage multiple client. Plugin states are a way for your plugins to create a state for each client
they are attached to.

You can create a state for your plugin by implementing the `NyxxPluginState` class and overriding
the `createState` method in your plugin. Any functionality that should be run in a separate instance
for each client should then be moved into the state class, which has the same methods as the main
plugin class: `beforeConnect`, `afterConnect`, `beforeClose` and `afterClose`.

:::caution
The methods in the state class should call the super-method to ensure that the main plugin class'
methods are also called.

Whether the method is called before or after your own code doesn't matter,
:::

For example, this plugin creates a timer for each client that periodically logs the client's guild
cache size:
```dart
class LogGuildCache extends NyxxPlugin<NyxxRest> {
  @override
  NyxxPluginState<NyxxRest, LogGuildCache> createState() => LogGuildCacheState(this);
}

class LogGuildCacheState extends NyxxPluginState<NyxxRest, LogGuildCache> {
  LogGuildCacheState(super.plugin);

  late final Timer timer;

  @override
  void afterConnect(NyxxRest client) {
    super.afterConnect(client);

    timer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 5), (timer) {
      logger.info('Guild cache size: ${client.guilds.cache.length}');
    });
  }

  @override
  void afterClose() {
    super.afterClose();

    timer.cancel();
  }
}
```

Each client this plugin is added to will have its own instance of `LogGuildCacheState`, so different
clients will have a different timer.
