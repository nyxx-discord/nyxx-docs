This guide explains how to perform common actions using nyxx. You can read through it in order, or
use the sidebar on the right to jump to a section you want to read.

## Connecting to the API

To connect to the Discord API, call one of the static methods on the `Nyxx` class. These methods
come in pairs: a `Nyxx.connectXXX` method and a `Nyxx.connectXXXWithOptions`. The `connectXXX`
methods are simply a shorter way to call `connectXXXWithOptions`.

Calling `Nyxx.connectXXX` allows you to create a connected client that uses the default API
configuration. If you want to configure API options, call `connectXXXWithOptions`.

There are several method pairs for different client types:
 - `Nyxx.connectRest` and `Nyxx.connectRestWithOptions` create a client that performs only HTTP
   requests using a bot token for authentication.
 - `Nyxx.connectGateway` and `Nyxx.connectGatewayWithOptions` create a client that performs HTTP 
   requests and receives events from Discord's Gateway using a bot token for authentication.
 - `Nyxx.connectOAuth2` and `Nyxx.connectOAuth2WithOptions` create a client that performs only HTTP
   requests using OAuth2 credentials for authentication.

For example, most bots will want to connect to the Gateway:
```dart
import 'package:nyxx/nyxx.dart';

void main() async {
  final client = await Nyxx.connectGateway('TOKEN', GatewayIntents.allUnprivileged);
}
```

All the connection methods also allow you to specify client options that allow you to add plugins to
your client and control caching. We recommend adding the `logging` and `cliIntegration` plugins to
all bots using nyxx:

```dart
import 'package:nyxx/nyxx.dart';

void main() async {
  final client = await Nyxx.connectGateway(
    'TOKEN',
    GatewayIntents.allUnprivileged,
    options: GatewayClientOptions(plugins: [logging, cliIntegration]),
  );
}
```

## Making API requests

To make requests to Discord's API, nyxx exposes methods on many of the different entity types.
Making an API request using them is as simple as calling that method:
```dart
final TextChannel channel = /* Get a channel from somewhere */;

// Send a message to that channel
await channel.sendMessage(MessageBuilder(content: 'Hello!'));
```

If you cannot get an instance of an entity or want to avoid an HTTP request that would be needed to
fetch it, nyxx allows you to make API requests using `Partial`s or `Manager`s:

```dart
final NyxxRest client = /* Your client */;
final Snowflake guildId = /* The ID of the guild */;

// List the guild's bans using a partial
await client.guilds[guildId].listBans();

// List the guild's bans using the client's guild manager
await client.guilds.listBans(guildId);
```

Using partials also allows you to access managers that aren't directly available on the client. For
example, listing the application (slash) commands in a guild using a partial is much more elegant
than using the manager directly:

```dart
final NyxxRest client = /* Your client */;
final Snowflake guildId = /* The ID of the guild */;

// List the guild's commands using a partial
await client.guilds[guildId].commands.list();

// List the guild's commands by creating a manager
await GuildApplicationCommandManager(
  client.options.applicationCommandConfig,
  client,
  applicationId: client.application.id,
  guildId: guildId,
  permissionsConfig: client.commandPermissionsConfig,
).list();
```

### Partial text channels

Partials are mostly simple to understand, but there is one exception to this rule:
`PartialTextChannel`s.

The `NyxxRest.channels` manager only provides access to `PartialChannel`s, which don't expose an
easy way to send messages to that channel - as it might not be a text channel. Additionally, there
is no method in `ChannelManager` that allows you to send a message to a channel as sending messages
is handled by `MessageManager`.

If we didn't treat this case specially, you'd have to write this to send a message to a channel
(without fetching it first):

```dart
await MessageManager(
  client.messageCacheConfig,
  client,
  channelId: channelId,
).create(MessageBuilder(content: 'Hello!'));
```

Therefore, nyxx exceptionally allows you to **cast the `PartialChannel` returned by the
`ChannelManager` to a `PartialTextChannel`**:

```dart
await (client.channels[channelId] as PartialTextChannel).sendMessage(
  MessageBuilder(content: 'Hello!'),
);
```

:::caution
Only do this if you are certain the channel is a text channel, or calling `sendMessage` will result
in an error.
:::

## Listening to events

To listen to events from Discord's Gateway (websocket API), first ensure your client is a
`NyxxGateway` by calling `Nyxx.connectGateway` or `Nyxx.connectGatewayWithOptions` when connecting
to the API.

Then, listen to any of the `onXXX` streams on the client objects to run your callback when that
event is omitted:

```dart
final client = await Nyxx.connectGateway(...);

client.onMessageCreate.listen((event) {
  final message = event.message;

  print('Received message in ${message.channelId} by ${message.author.id}');
});
```

:::info
Most events emitted on these streams (subtypes of [`DispatchEvent`](https://pub.dev/documentation/nyxx/latest/nyxx/DispatchEvent-class.html))
contain the object relevant to the event (e.g `MessageCreateEvent.message`) and/or several
additional fields with extra information (e.g `MessageCreateEvent.mentions`).

Most `XXXUpdateEvent`s will also contain the previously cached object if possible.
:::

You can also leverage Dart's powerful `Stream` API or use them in `await for` loops:

```dart
final client = await Nyxx.connectGateway(...);

await for (final MessageCreateEvent(:message) in client.onMessageCreate) {
  print('Received message in ${message.channelId} by ${message.author.id}');
}
```

### Advanced events

To listen for events other than `DispatchEvent`s, listen to `Gateway.messages`. This is a stream of
`ShardMessage`s - control messages sent by Gateway shard connections running in separate isolates
back to the main client.

The `EventReceived` message is sent when an event is received on the Gateway of any type, including
heartbeak acks and any other gateway event:

```dart
final client = await Nyxx.connectGateway(...);

client.gateway.messages.listen((message) {
  if (message is! EventReceived) return;

  final event = message.event;

  print('Received event ${event.opcode.value} (${event.opcode.name})');
});
```

:::caution
`EventReceived.event` will never be an instance of `DispatchEvent` as the parsing of dispatch events
only takes place once the client has processed them.

Instead, `RawDispatchEvent`s are emitted containing the raw event payload.

## Command framework

Some Discord libraries come with an in-built commands framework. While nyxx does have a commands
framework, it lives in a separate package: [`nyxx_commands`](https://pub.dev/packages/nyxx_commands)

There is a tutorial for using nyxx_commands [here](../tutorials/using_nyxx_commands).
