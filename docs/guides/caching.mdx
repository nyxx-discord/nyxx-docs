Nyxx implements caching as is recommended by Discord. This guide lists cache features and pitfalls
in the library.

## Cache locations

Caches in nyxx are represented as instances of the `Cache` type, which is effectively a `Map` with
extra features.

Most managers will have a cache for the type of entity they manage, such as `client.users.cache` or
`channel.messages.cache`. Some managers have extra caches for other related entity types, such as
`guild.commands.permissionsCache`.

If you ever want to inspect all the cached entities for a given client, the `Cache.cachesFor` method
will return a view of all cached entities. Note that modifying the returned map does not affect the
caches themselves.

## Cache configuration

Caches in nyxx can be configured using the `CacheConfig` class which is passed to the
`ClientOptions` when creating your client. For entity types that have multiple caches, such as
`Message`s (one cache per `TextChannel`), the config applies to each cache individually.

You can also manage caches imperatively by calling the `Map` methods on the cache - `cache.clear()`
will clear a cache, `cache.removeWhere` can be used for filtering and any other `Map` method works
as expected.

## Cache usage

Nyxx provides partial entities that manage most of the caching for you - the `SnowflakeEntity.get()`
method first tries to fetch the entity from its cache before fetching it from the Discord API.

If you want to manually access a cache's entries, the entities in the cache are mapped by their ID.

:::caution
Entities may be unexpectedly removed from a cache during a cache filter, so we recommend extracting
an entity from the cache as early as possible and storing it in a local variable to avoid losing it
and needing to re-fetch it.
:::

## Cache population

Caches can be populated in two different ways:

1. Making HTTP requests using a `Manager` will cache entities returned from the API.

   For example, using `client.channels.fetch()` will place the returned channel into
   `client.channels.cache`.

2. Entities received over the Gateway will be cached in the relevant manager's cache.

   For example, receiving a `MessageCreateEvent` will place the message into
   `channel.messages.cache` for the message's channel. `XXXUpdateEvent`s will also update the entity
   in the cache.

:::caution
Since the cache relies on Gateway `XXXUpdateEvent`s to stay up to date, entities are not removed
from the cache based on how long they have been in it - there is no cache expiry.

If you are using a client that does not connect to the Gateway (e.g `NyxxRest`) or have disabled the
intent associated with events for a certain entity type, you might want to set the
`CacheConfig.maxSize` for that entity to 0 (effectively disabling the cache), since entities in the
cache will not be updated.

If you do not disable the cache, keep in mind that the cache contents may not be up to date, and use
methods that bypass cache checks if an up to date version of the entity is needed.
