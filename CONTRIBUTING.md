# Contributing

Nyxx is free and open-source project, and all contributions are welcome and highly appreciated. However, please conform to the following guidelines when possible.

## Writing docs
Docs are written in markdown format and compiled with the [glacier](https://pub.dev/packages/glacier) package. Write your docs in the `src` directory and compile them to HTML with `glacier generate`. Then, run `glacier serve` and naviguate to the designated URL in a browser to preview your changes.

You can rerun `glacier generate` while `glacier serve` is running and reload the page in your browser to make real-time changes.
